# CustomStylesheet
MantisBT plugin for an additional stylesheet

Adds CSS properties without modifying the core CSS files or creating an extra theme.

On config page just enter the (relative) URL to your CSS file

Example:  

    your custom CSS file is saved in css/myCustomStylesheet.css
    just enter in the plugin config page "css/myCustomStylesheet.css"

The custom CSS file is included via HTML. So make sure it is accessible via http/s requests
